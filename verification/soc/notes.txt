Youtube string: SOC MITCOE

When Verification completes?
is Functional coverage done?
is RTL code exercised? (code coverage)
for last few weeks no bug?
MDV 100%?
Others: Time to chip

Verification approaches:
1. Top-down: System to IPs
System spec
System Design
HW IPs library
SW IPs library
Netlist verification
Timing verification

2. Down-Top: IPs to System
3. Platform based: To check interconnection like for newly added IPs

Types of Verification Tests:
1. Random Testing
2. Functional testing
3. compliance testing
4. corner case testing
5. FW testing

Verification Tools:
1. Simulation
 Event driven - Timing accurate
 Transaction based - needs BFM
2. Code Coverge based
3. AMS verification(spice accurate)
4. Predicator based TB automated simulation like UVM
Static
 - Lint - Identify simple errors in early design cycle
 - STA - checks timing related problems without user input patterns, faster
 - Formal - Checks functionality only- (model & equivalence check) - many types one is FPV, mostly check for simple blocks as it require more, 100% theoritically proven
Hardware  modeling - netlist model simulation
Emulation - Test the system in a hardware
Rapid prototyping - FPGA/ASIC test chip
