#suppress unwanted gpe at startup
#ref: http://askubuntu.com/questions/176565/why-does-kworker-cpu-usage-get-so-high
Instead I think this CPU usage is not normal and is related to the well-known kworker bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/887793

The solution for me and for many others was, first of all, find out the "gpe" that is causing the bad stuff with something like:

grep . -r /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/
and check for an high value (mine was gpe13 - with a value like 200K - so, you have to change it accordingly, if differs). After that:

~ cp /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe13 /pathtobackup
~ crontab -e
Add this line, so it will be executed every startup/reboot:

@reboot echo "disable" > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe13
Save/exit. Then, to make it work also after wakeup from suspend:

~ touch /etc/pm/sleep.d/30_disable_gpe13
~ chmod +x /etc/pm/sleep.d/30_disable_gpe13
~ vim /etc/pm/sleep.d/30_disable_gpe13
Add this stuff:

#!/bin/bash
case "$1" in
    thaw|resume)
        echo disable > /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts/gpe13 2>/dev/null
        ;;
    *)
        ;;
esac
exit $?
Save/exit, done.
