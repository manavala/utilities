///Things to consider for formal

http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1205241

1. do not over (tight) constraint i.e., 'legal stimulus' so that not all values are exercised, 
so that bugs might be screened, then RTL looks like bug free - Coverage solves this
a != b instead of !(a&b) as a & b shouldn't be one
2. avoid wrong assertions - Debug with Cntr Ex
3. avoid under(no) constraints - Debug with Cntr Ex
4. avoid in-sufficient assertions - Solves with assertion coverage
5. Existing assertion still not powerful - solving is challenging eg like == instead of ===, etc

Advantages:
1. Before the simulation, can find bugs at block level
2. We will more concentrate on spec
3. Properties also attached/included with RTL
4. 

Cntr Ex:

Doulus //Formal Verification for Non-Specialists

Bug hunting
Assurance, particulary of complex control logic
Checking simple things like RTL linting, connectivity, coverage waivers
Forces you to understand the spec
Post-silicon debug

Simulation/Emulation is for end-to-end ( use cases ==> golden cases )
Formal is for the bug hunting
Specify a assertion/coverpoint to formal to hunt, formal will try to fail that condition as Golden Nuggets
In Simulation, assume acts as assertion
Also Simulation will help to check not overconstrained, best thing to do this is using cover points add what condition need to be tested

run] $ vcf -gui -f selAB.tcl
run] $ cat selAB.tcl
read_file -format sverilog -sva -top selAB -vcs {selAB.sv}
create_clock clk -period 100
sim_run -stable
sim_save_reset
check_fv -block
report_fv
