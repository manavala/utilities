AXI is for:
high BW without bridges
meets interface requirements for wide range of componenets like USB,PCIe, UART,I2C, etc
suitable for memory controllers initial high access latency
Flexibility for inteconnect
Backward compatible for APB, AHB

Features:
separate address/control and data phases
unaligned data transfers - using stroes
just start address with burst of transfers
separate Rd & Wr data channels for DMA
out-of-order cause of multiple outstanding
"permits easy addition of register stages t provide timing closure" - no idea

"independant" Channels:
Read address
Read data
Write address
Write data
Write response

Master Writes Address and Data to Slave
Slave Response to Master
Master request Data for some address to Slave
Slave response with data

"Transaction" is valid if "valid" is high
"Transaction" is accepeted only if "ready" to accept
"Last" signal only in Write/Read "Data" channels

Data channel:
Both Read data and response from slave to master with 2^3 to 2^10 bits wide
Keep writing "buffered" data of 2^3 to 2^10 bits width to slave without expecting acknowledge/response. Strobe confirms which "byte" are valid to write
