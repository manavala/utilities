Youtube "The ARM University Program, ARM Architecture Fundamentals"

1. From the arm only the Debug port is visible
2. cores takes only two interrupt inputs
3. so the most common periperhal connected will be interrupt controller
4. within the device components are connected together with the arm on-chip interconnect bus architecture
5. It can have all the bus types like AXI (sometimes AHB) for high performance and APB for low power peripherals
6. Generally AXI will be for the Memory and high-speed devices
7. A8 - 13 stage pipeline
8. A9 -  8 stage pipeline

v7:
1. Memory Management Support (MMU) - virtual memory system to support Linux
2. Security extensions like payment
3. 40 bit physical address
4. Hardware virtualization

Risc architecture:
1. Load store architecture - can directly deal with the memory
2.
